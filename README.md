Grid Based Outlier Detection

Outlier detection is one of the most widely used
technique to identify abnormal behavior in raw data. The sense
of abnormal deviation mentioned here accounts for human or
system errors that naturally occur as part of the data. In this
paper, we propose a new algorithm called Grid Based Outlier
Detection (GBOD) to find the hidden outliers in large data sets.
In contrast to existing grid based methods which are limited to
only some statistical based approaches, the GBOD algorithm
is raised with two alternations to figure out different range of
outliers depending upon the interest of the user. First, number
of points in local grid is used to decide whether a point is an
outlier or not. Whereas, the second part is an approach to give
an outlier score for each points in case of the outlier score is
important for the decision making. The simple structure makes
this algorithm extremely effective for large data sets, while
existing algorithms weaken in this challenge.
